# Transfer image to cross stitch pattern

This repo contains the project that could change the image to its cross stitch pattern. By given a picture with relatively less background color, the functions could transfer to matching cross stitch. The cross stitch pattern could be colored, black-white; the user could also decide whether to color the background in the result pattern.

The section of the repo are: function, vignette, and sample picture.

function is the folder with code:

- change_resolution-1.R credits to Professor Daniel Simpson.

- functions.R contains four different functions.

- similar_pic.jpg is the sample picture, credit to Andy Warhol.

vignette contains instruction of using these functions.
